# The Goal

Gain a high-level understanding of "work" flowing through *all* projects a team
maintains over time.

---

## The Reality

  1. The team works in Git; issues and Pull Requests are used often.
  2. Using an additional tool - TFS, Jira, Confluence - for tracking work has
    not worked in the past.
  3. Git repositories are spread out between: many organizations, both public
    GitHub and Enterprise.
