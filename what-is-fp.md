# Functional Programming

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming *paradigm*; a style, or way, of
solving problems. FP aims to make software execution similar to evaluation of
mathematical expressions.

## FP Features

### Requirements

  1. Purity - referential transparency
  2. First-class functions
  3. Higher-order functions

### Common

  - Strict/Non-strict evaluation (eager/lazy)
  - Type system
  - Code reuse

### Others

  - Curry(-ing
  - Partial Application
  - Composition
  - Recursion
  - Closure (lexical scoping)
  - Algebraic Data Types
  - Functor
  - Applicatives
  - Monads
  - Monoids
  - Applicative Functors
  - Continuation
  - Continuation Passing Style (CPS)
  - Point-free

# WHY

  1. Computationally distributable.
  2. Easier to (for humans) reason about; smaller decomposed pieces.
